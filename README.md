> A regular expression, 
also known as **regex** or **regexp**, is essentially a ***search query*** for text that's expressed by string pattern.
When you run a search against a particular piece of text, anything that matches a regular expression pattern you specified, 
is returned as a result of the search. Regular expressions let you answer the questions like what are all the four-letter words in a file?
Or how many different error types are there in this error log? In other words, regular expressions allow us to search a text for strings
matching a specific ***pattern***.
in this training We'll check out how we can apply the ***regexs to processing, parsing and extracting meaning from texts*** read by our scripts. 
And we'll look at a bunch of different examples where we can use regular expressions to solve some real world problems.
